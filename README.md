# TimeAndTemp

Made as a way to create a python project to show the tempreature and time on an rasberry pi

## OUTLINE

First things first need to find out if everything that runs on a Rasberry pi has to be in Python

Then i need to learn some python....

- Pretty much i need an api fetch of the weather in where I am 

- Then look at whether i can auto grab the timezone from the pi itself or from something else?
  - Seems silly to use the API for that alone

## BONUS

Look over grabbing football scores?

- If so maybe able to creat the live football ticker that I have been thinking about for a while
  - Gonna need to look up a relevant API to grab that information though....
