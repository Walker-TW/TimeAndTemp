# TimeAndTemp

Made as a way to create a python project to show the tempreature and time on an rasberry pi

## OUTLINE

First things first need to find out if everything that runs on a Rasberry pi has to be in Python?

- It doesnt but this seems like a good thing to mess around with and have a look

Then i need to learn some python....

- Pretty much i need an api fetch of the weather in where I am

- Then look at whether i can auto grab the timezone from the pi itself or from something else?
  - Seems silly to use the API for that alone

## Things To Do

- First be able to fetch an API (so learn how to do that)
- Sign up to required info and grab what is needed
- Link that info to a set of images to display (use a hashmap for the images?)
- Display require info on the monitor (NOOOOO idea on how to do this)
  - View npm-esque packages that could do this?
  - The example listed in your own personal folders could be a way to at least have a look at this

## BONUS

Look over grabbing football scores?

- If so maybe able to creat the live football ticker that I have been thinking about for a while
  - Gonna need to look up a relevant API to grab that information though....
